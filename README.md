A simple web application that displays random quotes when the  button is clicked. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click the button repeatedly to see different quotes each time.

A random quote generator using an API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fetches quotes from an external API and displays them on a webpage. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

HTML: The HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, including a container to display the quote and a button to trigger the API call to get a new quote.

CSS: The CSS file styles the webpage, ensuring it looks visually appealing with appropriate fonts, colors, and layout.

JavaScript: The JavaScript code handles the API call and updates the quote on the webpage dynamically.

API: An external API is used to fetch random quotes. The API returns a random quote in JSON format, which the JavaScript code extracts and displays on the webpage.
